<h3> My name is Jayrald Brix Oracion. 
  I'm 18 years old 
  And a first-year college student at QUEZON CITY UNIVERSITY, 
  Taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). 
  My favorite sport is skateboarding, and I also enjoy camping with my family and friends.</h3>
<br>
<h2>My dream is to become a programmer someday. 
  For now, I'm focused on learning the basic parts of programming, 
  And I hope to continue until I graduate from college. 
  Besides that, I also dream of traveling to different places to go camping."</h2>
